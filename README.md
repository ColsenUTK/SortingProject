This code takes a list of numbers in arbitrary order as an input. It then 
uses a sorting algorithm and returns the new list. The sorting methods are 
oblivious (none), stl, qsort, quick sort, and merge sort.

To generate a file of random numbers, use the following command:
    
    ./generatelist [num ints]

If that doesn't work, precede it with:
    
    g++ -o generatelist generateFiles.cpp
